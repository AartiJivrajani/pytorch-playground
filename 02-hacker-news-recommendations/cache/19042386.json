For example, there are about 30K immigrants from Serbia to Germany each year. From Croatia to Germany it\u0026#x27;s about 50K per year. Significant number of them are doctors and nurses. Average salary (and consequently, pension) in most of central and eastern European countries is quite low, making  nursing homes unaffordable. This, combined with the fact that a lot of children\u0026#x2F;relatives now live 1000+km away and that the prisons are, say, not well known for friendliness there makes situation quite dire for current and future pensioners there.\u003c/p\u003e","points":null,"parent_id":19043174,"story_id":19042386,"children":[{"id":19043712,"created_at":"2019-01-31T10:05:22.000Z","created_at_i":1548929122,"type":"comment","author":"mschuster91","title":null,"url":null,"text":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; Significant number of them are doctors and nurses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#x27;m half-German, half-Croat.
